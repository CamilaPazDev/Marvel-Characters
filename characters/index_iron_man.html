        <h2>Who is Iron Man?</h2>
        <p>Inventor Tony Stark applies his genius for high-tech solutions to problems as Iron Man, the armored Avenger.</p>
        <h2>Awakening the Witch</h2>
        <p>Genius inventor Tony Stark continued his father Howard Stark’s weaponry business after his parents’ untimely deaths and flew it to even greater heights of innovation. While in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new missile for the U.S. military, Stark’s convoy came under fire by a terrorist group known as the Ten Rings and he was severely wounded. Taken prisoner by the group, Stark awoke in their headquarters to learn that shrapnel near his heart had nearly cost him his life, but swift action by scientist and fellow prisoner Ho Yinsen—who had inserted a powerful electromagnet in Stark’s chest—would prolong it temporarily.

            Stalling his captors after they demanded he build them a new weapon, Stark replaced the magnet with the RT, a miniature version of a device originally designed by his father, the Arc Reactor. Furthermore, he and Yinsen created a crude suit of armor which could provide them the means with which to escape. The suit worked as planned, though Yinsen sacrificed himself in order to allow Tony enough time to power it up to fight their terrorist captors.</p>    
        <h2>Tony’s Heart</h2>
        <p>Some of Tony Stark’s closest friends, allies, and associates are people he works with.

            Pepper Potts began as Stark’s personal assistant. She quickly proves her value to him by essentially making sure he survives each day as the owner of Stark Industries, therefore earning his trust to step into the role of CEO. On a personal level, the two develop deep feelings for each other that grows into a romance for the ages. Tony Stark cannot see his life as anything without Pepper Potts, and he hopes to prove it every single day they’re together, through thick and thin.</p>
